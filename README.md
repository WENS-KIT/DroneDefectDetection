DroneDefectDetection


This paper proposes a drone defect detection scheme based on acoustic signals using Recurrence Plot (RP)
and deep learning to detect drone defects and prevent damage caused by accidents in advance. The acoustic
signals of a recurring pattern generated by the drone rotor are imaged using RP, and the drone defects are
detected using the image recognition deep learning model YOLOv5. On the roof of a four-story building, RP
datasets are constructed using the acoustic signals generated by the normal and abnormal drones composed of
the Bebop 2 drone, and the YOLOv5 model is trained and inferred through the anaconda virtual environment
on a Windows PC. Through comparative evaluation with mel-spectrogram, widely used for speech recognition,
the classification accuracy and operation time are measured to prove the superiority of the performance of the
proposed scheme. The accuracy of the proposed scheme is 97.5%, which is confirmed to be very accurate, and
the future research direction is discusse
